# Firefox Pinned Icons
This repository contains vector icons for common web services like Google, GitLab, and Figma.

## What is this?
Firefox does not allow users to upload custom icons for Pinned Shortcuts on the New Tab screen; users are only allowed to provide a URL for a custom icon. I have created 8 SVGs, sourced directly from each service, to be hosted in this repository. With the SVGs hosted on GitHub, it should be possible to get a direct URL to each icon, and this method provide a reliable way to use custom icons for Pinned Shortcuts in Firefox.
